## Challenge and Approach

Itâ€™s incredibly difficult navigating the web of government housing assistance programs. 

How do you know what programs you qualify for? More importantly, how do I find homes that qualify for these assistance programs?

Rye simplifies the complex web of government provided regulation and helps customers find homes that may be funded by the government.

Our approach for satisfying this challenge was to:

- Collect Data from Zillow and HUD
- Reference with data user input
- Return a simple result of houses and programs the user may be qualified for
